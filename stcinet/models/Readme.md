This repository contains 5 variants of our proposed STCINet model:

1. STCINet <sup>+</sup> (our predictive model without the deconfounding or attention modules)
2. STCINet-NA (model with deconfounding but no attention (NA) mechanism)
3. STCINet-SA (model with deconfounding and spatial attention (SA) mechanism)
4. STCINet-AG (model with deconfounding and attention gating (AG) mechanism)
5. STCINet (complete model with deconfounding, spatial attention and attention gating mechanism)

There are two notebooks for generating synthetic data:
1. With spatial interference
2. Without spatial interference

For real world data, we downloaded the following variables from [ERA5](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels-monthly-means) on monthly frequency:

1. Latent Heat FLux (Pan-Arctic region: 60-90N)
2. Sensible Heat Flux (Pan-Arctic region: 60-90N)
3. Longwave downward radiation (Pan-Arctic region: 60-90N)

The monthly sea ice concentrations data was accessed from National Snow and Ice Data Center [NSIDC](https://nsidc.org/data/smmr_ssmi/data) for the Arctic region.

To apply treatment on selective regions, we utilized the [region mask](https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0780/versions/1) from NSIDC.

The post-processed real-world data is publicly available to download from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lAg393qAWkpXthfAp3v1YohP4B0zNh1h/view?usp=drive_link)
